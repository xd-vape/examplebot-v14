  DiscordJS Bot
</h1>

<p align="center"><b>This bot is written in Javascript with the DiscordJS V14 framework!</b></p>

<p align="center">This is an example bot that I will update over time. This will get more things over time. You can also download this bot and work on it yourself. This bot is only there so I can learn javascript. I want to be able to properly master and understand the Javascript programming language at some point</p>

# ToDo list

- [X] Add Command Handler
- [X] Add first Command (like Ping)  
- [ ] Add Events (like guildMemberAdd, guildMemberRemove)

> So these are the first things that still need to be done. As already written, this bot should be updated over time so that this is sometime a complete bot that you only have to download and set a few things!

# Feature
**At this time the bot has no features, these will come with time!**
